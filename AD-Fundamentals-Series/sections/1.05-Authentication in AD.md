# 🏆 `Section 1.5` | AD - **“Authentication in Active Directory”**

Up to now, we have talked about what a directory service is, how AD is structured, and how it is powered by domain controllers and global catalogs.  
Now it is time to focus on the most important job of all: **Authentication**.  
This is how AD verifies who you are and lets you in.

## 🔑 The Core Job of Authentication
Authentication is about proving identity. In AD, that usually means you type a username and password, and AD confirms whether those credentials are valid.  

Under the hood, AD mainly uses **two protocols**: **Kerberos** and **NTLM**.

---

## 🎫 Kerberos – the modern standard
Kerberos is the **default authentication protocol** in AD. It is secure, efficient, and designed for **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

**How it works, step by step:**
1. You log on with your username and password.  
2. The password is not sent across the network. Instead, it is used to prove your identity to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, which runs on every Domain Controller.  
3. If successful, you receive a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** → your master pass.  
4. When you access a service (like a file share or application), you present the TGT to the KDC and request a **service ticket**.  
5. The KDC issues the service ticket, which you present to the target server.  

**Why Kerberos is strong:**  
- Passwords never travel on the network; tickets do  
- Tickets have time limits → reduces risk if stolen  
- One login = multiple services (true SSO)

## 🧮 NTLM – the legacy fallback
Before Kerberos, there was **NTLM (NT LAN Manager)**. It is still supported for compatibility, but it is weaker.

**How NTLM works:**
- Client sends a hashed username to the server  
- Server challenges the client with a random number  
- Client encrypts the challenge with the user’s password hash and sends it back  
- Server verifies the response  

**Problems with NTLM:**  
- Relies on password hashes → vulnerable to **Pass-the-Hash** attacks  
- No mutual authentication → client cannot verify the server’s identity  
- Less efficient → every request requires contacting a Domain Controller  

⚡ In short: NTLM is a **backup only**, not the recommended standard.

## 🔒 Putting it together
In modern AD environments:  
- **Kerberos** is the default for domain-joined clients and services  
- **NTLM** only kicks in if Kerberos cannot be used (older systems, non-domain joined machines, misconfigurations)  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- Authentication in AD relies on two protocols: **Kerberos** (modern, secure) and **NTLM** (legacy)  
- Kerberos uses tickets, supports SSO, and avoids sending passwords  
- NTLM is older, less secure, and should be phased out whenever possible
