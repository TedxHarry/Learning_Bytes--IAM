# 1.11 AD vs Azure AD

Most teams feel pulled between two worlds. **Active Directory** solved on‑prem Windows identity. **Cloud identity** solves web and mobile. They overlap but solve different problems.

🌐 **What AD does best**
- Manage domain‑joined machines; **Group Policy**
- **Kerberos/NTLM** for Windows and legacy apps
- **LDAP** directory lookups and on‑prem integration
- Authoritative identity store for on‑prem estates

☁️ **What Azure AD does best**
- Issues tokens for modern apps (**OAuth/SAML/OIDC**)
- Built for cloud‑scale web auth
- Native SaaS and mobile integration
- Not a drop‑in replacement for DCs or Group Policy

🔍 **Key differences**
- **Protocols**: Kerberos/LDAP vs token‑based
- **Device control**: GPO vs MDM
- **Ops model**: DCs/replication vs global cloud service
- **Integration**: legacy LDAP binds vs modern tokens

🧭 **When to use which**
- Keep AD where devices/legacy/Kerberos demand it
- Use cloud identity where apps accept modern tokens and you want SaaS SSO
- Most live in both worlds for a long time

✅ **Takeaway**
AD runs the device/protocol world. Cloud identity runs the app/token world. Map workloads and choose accordingly.
