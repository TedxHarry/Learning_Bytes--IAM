# 🏆 `Section 1.11` | AD Fundamentals - **“AD vs Azure AD: Key Differences and Why Both Exist”**

Most teams feel pulled between two worlds.  
Active Directory solved identity for **on-prem Windows environments**.  
Cloud identity services solved identity for **web and mobile apps**.  

They overlap, but they solve different problems. Learn both so you can pick the right tool for each job.

---

## 🌐 What Active Directory does best
- Manages domain-joined machines and applies **Group Policy** to control device behavior and settings  
- Provides **Kerberos** and **NTLM** authentication used by Windows services and many legacy apps  
- Hosts **LDAP** for directory lookups and on-prem application integration  
- Acts as the **authoritative store for identities** in many enterprises, especially where on-prem servers and legacy services exist  

---

## ☁️ What Azure AD does best
- Issues tokens for modern apps using **OAuth** and **SAML** for Single Sign-On  
- Designed for **cloud scale** and web authentication flows rather than device management  
- Integrates natively with **SaaS apps, mobile clients, and modern developer workflows**  
- Does **not** act as a drop-in replacement for on-prem domain controllers or Group Policy  

---

## 🔍 Key Practical Differences to Remember
- **Protocols and tokens** → AD relies on Kerberos and LDAP; Azure AD relies on tokens and modern protocols  
- **Device and policy control** → AD controls device configuration through Group Policy; Azure AD relies on MDM for device posture  
- **Operational model** → AD needs domain controllers, replication, and network reachability; Azure AD is globally available but depends on correct sync or federation design  
- **Integration surface** → Some legacy apps expect LDAP binds or Windows integrated auth and cannot be migrated without change  

---

## 🧭 When Each One is the Right Choice
- Keep **AD** where devices, legacy apps, or Kerberos-dependent services require it  
- Use **Azure AD** where apps accept modern tokens, you want seamless SaaS SSO, or you need global scale  
- Most environments live in **both worlds** for a long time → the goal is not replacement overnight but a clear mapping of apps and devices to the right identity model  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
Active Directory and Azure AD solve related but different problems.  
- **AD runs the device and protocol world**  
- **Azure AD runs the app and token world**  

Learn both, map your estate, and choose the pattern that fits each workload.
