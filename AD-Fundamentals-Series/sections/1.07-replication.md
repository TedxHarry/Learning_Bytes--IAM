# 1.7 High Availability and Replication

Active Directory must be resilient. AD achieves this with **multiple DCs** and **replication**.

🖥️ **Multiple Domain Controllers**
- Survive a DC outage
- Balance load
- Enable maintenance without downtime

🔄 **Multi‑Master Replication**
- Any DC can accept changes; they replicate to others
- Conflicts resolved via **USNs** and timestamps

🌐 **Intra‑Site vs Inter‑Site**
- **Intra‑Site:** fast LAN, frequent/near‑immediate replication
- **Inter‑Site:** WAN, compressed and scheduled to save bandwidth

📖 **Global Catalog and Replication**
- GC servers replicate partial forest data for fast searches and universal group evaluation

✅ **Takeaway**
- HA via multiple DCs  
- Replication keeps DCs consistent  
- Site‑aware behavior optimizes speed vs bandwidth
