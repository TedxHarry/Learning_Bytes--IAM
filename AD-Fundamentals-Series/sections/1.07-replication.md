# 🏆 `Section 1.7` | AD Fundamentals - **“High Availability and Replication”**

Active Directory is the backbone of enterprise identity, which means it cannot afford downtime or inconsistencies.  
To achieve resilience, AD uses **multiple domain controllers** and a **replication model** that keeps data in sync across the environment.

---

## 🖥️ Multiple Domain Controllers
Every domain should have more than one **Domain Controller (DC)**. Why?  

- If one DC goes down, others can continue authenticating users  
- Workloads are balanced, improving performance  
- Maintenance can be done without halting logons  

Because each DC holds a copy of the AD database, **consistency becomes critical** — and that’s where replication enters the picture.

---

## 🔄 Multi-Master Replication
AD uses a **multi-master replication model**, which means changes can be made on any DC and then synchronized across others.  

For example:  
1. A user is created in DC1  
2. The change replicates to DC2, DC3, and beyond  
3. All DCs eventually hold the same information  

This is different from a single-master model, where only one server could accept updates.  
Multi-master ensures availability but also introduces the need for **conflict resolution**.

---

## 🌐 Intra-Site vs Inter-Site Replication
Replication is designed to be efficient across networks.  

- **Intra-Site Replication:** within the same site (fast LAN). Changes replicate frequently and almost immediately.  
- **Inter-Site Replication:** across different sites (WAN). Replication is compressed, less frequent, and scheduled to conserve bandwidth.  

This distinction ensures AD performs well whether you are in one office or spread worldwide.

---

## 📖 Global Catalog and Replication
Replication also ensures that **Global Catalog (GC)** servers hold a **partial copy of every object** across the forest.  
This allows for fast searches and **universal group evaluations** during logon, even across domains.

---

## ⚙️ Conflict Handling
Since any DC can accept changes, what happens if two admins update the same user at the same time?  

AD uses **Update Sequence Numbers (USNs)** and **timestamps** to determine which change wins.  
This system resolves conflicts automatically in most cases.

---

## 🔑 Why this matters
- Multiple DCs ensure **high availability**  
- Replication keeps data **consistent** across the forest  
- Site-aware replication balances **speed vs bandwidth efficiency**  
- Conflict handling ensures **stability** even in distributed environments  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- High availability in AD comes from deploying **multiple DCs**  
- Replication ensures all DCs remain consistent  
- **Intra-site** replication = fast & frequent  
- **Inter-site** replication = scheduled & optimized  
- The design allows AD to scale reliably across locations
