# 🏆 `Section 1.13` | AD Fundamentals - **“Hybrid Identity Patterns: Sync, Federation, Pass-Through Auth, Password Hash Sync”**

Hybrid identity is a toolbox. Each pattern changes **where authentication happens**, **what data lives in the cloud**, and **what you must operate and monitor**.  
Pick the pattern that fits your security, availability, and app constraints.

---

## 🔐 Password Hash Sync
- Hashes are synced to the cloud so cloud auth works even if on-prem is offline  
- Simple and resilient for widespread SaaS adoption  
- Small risk trade-off, because password hashes reside in the cloud  
- Align **UPN** and password policies before rollout  

---

## 🔁 Pass-Through Authentication
- Cloud sign-ins are validated by an **on-prem agent** in real time  
- No password hashes stored in the cloud; the cloud only brokers authentication  
- Plan for **agent high availability** and monitor **network reachability**, because sign-ins depend on those agents  

---

## 🏛 Federation with an On-Prem IdP
- On-prem IdP issues tokens for cloud apps using **SAML or OIDC**  
- Gives full control for conditional access and custom auth flows  
- Requires running and securing extra infrastructure, but allows centralized advanced policies  

---

## ☁️ Cloud-First Provisioning
- Identity is created or provisioned in the cloud with minimal on-prem dependency  
- Best when devices are **MDM-managed** and apps accept modern tokens  
- Needs phased rollout and **app compatibility checks** to avoid surprises  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
Hybrid identity is about **trade-offs between control, resilience, and complexity**.  
Test a small wave, watch sign-in logs, and always have fallback plans for agent or network failures.
