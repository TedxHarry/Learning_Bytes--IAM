# 🏆 `Section 1.15` | AD Fundamentals - **“Practical Pitfalls and Migration Considerations”**

Migrations look simple on paper. In real life, small, hidden assumptions break things fast.  
Learn the common traps and apply a few simple safeguards — you will save days of firefighting.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- UPN and sign-in mismatch that confuses users and floods support  
- Bad identity matching that creates duplicate or orphaned accounts  
- Over-syncing privileged or service accounts and widening the blast radius  
- Assuming every app accepts modern tokens and skipping compatibility checks  
- No fallback for agent or network failure, causing broad auth outages  
- Ignoring AD health checks like time, DNS, and replication before you start  

---

## 🛡 Essential Safeguards
- Inventory apps and document how each authenticates  
- Pilot a small OU and validate apps, SSO, and password flows  
- Exclude high-privilege and service accounts until monitoring and controls are ready  
- Confirm UPN, mail, and matching rules on samples before bulk sync  
- Ensure agent high availability and define fallback behavior for sign-ins  
- Centralize logs and alert on sign-in anomalies and sync errors from day one  

---

## 🧭 Quick Rollback and Cutover Checklist
- Pre-sync export of user attributes and object lists for reconciliation  
- Final UPN and attribute sanity check completed for pilot users  
- Agent HA verified and fallback behavior tested  
- Monitoring and alerts active for sign-ins and sync failures  
- Rollback steps documented and owners assigned  
- Support team briefed with remediation commands and communication plan  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
Plan for small failures. Test matching, limit scope, protect privileged accounts, and have a simple rollback you can run under pressure.  
Move in waves and validate every app that touches identity.
