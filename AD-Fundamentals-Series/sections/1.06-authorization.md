# 🏆 `Section 1.6` | AD Fundamentals - **“Authorization and Security in AD”**

Authentication answers **“Who are you?”**.  
Authorization answers **“What can you do?”**.  

Once AD knows your identity, it must decide what rights you have inside the system. This is where **authorization** and **security controls** come into play.

---

## 🧩 Security Principals
In AD, any object that can be granted access is called a **security principal**.  
That includes **users, groups, and computers**.  

Each security principal is assigned a unique identifier called a **SID (Security Identifier)**.  
SIDs are what the system actually uses when making access decisions, not usernames.

---

## 📜 Access Control
Access is managed through **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** attached to objects.  

Each ACL is made up of **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**, which link a SID to a permission.  
For example:  
> *“SID for Finance group can read this folder.”*

When you log in, AD builds your **access token**.  
This token contains:  
- Your SID  
- SIDs of all the groups you belong to  
- Your privileges  

Every time you access a resource, your token is compared against the ACL on that resource.

---

## 👥 Groups and Authorization
Groups are central to authorization because they **simplify management**.  
Instead of giving permissions to 500 users individually, you give them to a group.  

- **Security groups** → control access to resources  
- **Distribution groups** → only for email, cannot be used for access  

⚠️ **Common pitfalls:**  
- Nested groups → make it hard to trace permissions  
- Token bloat → too many group memberships, slowing logons and making troubleshooting painful

---

## 🔒 Privileged Groups
Some groups have enormous power in AD:  
- **Domain Admins**  
- **Enterprise Admins**  

These accounts can control almost everything.  
Because of their sensitivity, they must be **tightly secured and monitored**.  
Many real-world attacks start by targeting privileged accounts.

---

## ⚠️ Security Considerations
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** → give users only what they need  
- Use **delegation** carefully → assign control at the OU level instead of global admin rights  
- Monitor **SID history** and **group membership changes**, as attackers often exploit these to escalate privileges  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- Authorization in AD is based on **SIDs, tokens, and ACLs**  
- Groups simplify management, but can create complexity if misused  
- Privileged accounts are high-value targets and must be locked down  
- **Least privilege** and **careful delegation** are golden rules for securing AD
