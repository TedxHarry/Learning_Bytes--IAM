# 1.6 Authorization and Security in AD

Authentication answers *who are you?* Authorization answers *what can you do?*

🧩 **Security Principals**
- Users, groups, computers — anything that can be granted access
- Each has a **SID** (Security Identifier)

📜 **Access Control**
- Objects have **ACLs** composed of **ACEs** linking a SID to permissions
- Your **access token** contains your SID, group SIDs, and privileges; it’s compared to ACLs on resources

👥 **Groups**
- Use **security groups** to grant access; **distribution groups** are for email
- Watch for nested groups and **token bloat**

🔒 **Privileged Groups**
- Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, etc. — high‑power targets; lock down and monitor

⚠️ **Security Considerations**
- Least privilege, careful delegation, monitor SID history and group changes

✅ **Takeaway**
- Authorization = SIDs, tokens, and ACLs  
- Groups simplify management; misuse adds complexity  
- Protect privileged accounts
