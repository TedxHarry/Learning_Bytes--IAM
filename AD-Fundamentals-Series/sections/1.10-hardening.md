# 🏆 `Section 1.10` | AD Fundamentals - **“Security and Hardening AD”**

Security in AD is practical. Attackers know how AD works and they target exactly the features that make it powerful.  
Below are the **real threats** you must understand and the **short, effective controls** that stop them.

---

## ⚠️ Real Attack Scenarios to Know
- 🧩 **Pass the Hash** → attackers steal credential hashes from a machine and reuse them to authenticate elsewhere.  
- 🔐 **Kerberoasting** → attackers request service tickets for service accounts, extract them, and crack the tickets offline to recover passwords.  
- 🎟️ **Golden Ticket** → if an attacker obtains KRBTGT hashes, they can forge Kerberos tickets and impersonate any account.  
- 🔁 **Lateral Movement & Escalation** → compromise one host, harvest credentials, move to servers and DCs, then elevate to privileged accounts.  

---

## 🛡 Practical Defenses that Stop Real Attackers
- 🔒 Remove NTLM and favor Kerberos where possible  
- 🔑 Use managed service accounts or a secrets vault and rotate service credentials automatically  
- 🧱 Apply least privilege and a **tiered admin model** to isolate high privilege  
- 💻 Require **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)** for admin tasks and enable **Just Enough Administration (JEA)**  
- 👀 Protect and monitor **KRBTGT** and **Domain Admins** closely, and alert on changes  
- 📊 Centralize logs and watch for **abnormal ticket requests, sudden group changes, and unusual logons**  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
Attack techniques exploit AD features.  
Defend with layered, practical controls:  
- Reduce the attack surface  
- Isolate privileges  
- Protect the highest-value accounts  
- Monitor for early signs of compromise  

👉 Make attacks **costly and slow**, not **easy and silent**.
