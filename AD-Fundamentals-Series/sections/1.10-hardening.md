# 1.10 Security and Hardening AD

Attackers know AD. Secure it with practical controls.

⚠️ **Real attacks**
- **Pass‑the‑Hash**
- **Kerberoasting**
- **Golden Ticket**
- Lateral movement and escalation

🛡 **Practical defenses**
- Favor Kerberos; reduce/disable NTLM
- Managed service accounts or vault + rotation
- Least privilege; tiered admin model; PAWs; JEA
- Protect/monitor **KRBTGT** and privileged groups
- Centralize logs; alert on abnormal tickets, group changes, unusual logons

✅ **Takeaway**
Attack techniques exploit AD features. Reduce attack surface, isolate privileges, protect high‑value accounts, and monitor relentlessly.
