# 1.5 Authentication in Active Directory

Authentication is how AD verifies who you are. Two protocols matter: **Kerberos** and **NTLM**.

ðŸŽ« **Kerberos â€” the modern default**
1. You sign in. Your password isnâ€™t sent; it proves identity to the **KDC** on a DC.  
2. You receive a **TGT** (Ticket Granting Ticket).  
3. When accessing a service, you ask the KDC for a **service ticket**.  
4. You present that ticket to the service.
**Why itâ€™s good:** passwords never traverse the network, tickets expire, and you get **SSO** across services.

ðŸ§® **NTLM â€” legacy fallback**
- Challengeâ€‘response using password hashes
- Vulnerable to **Passâ€‘theâ€‘Hash**; no mutual authentication
- Less efficient (more DC contact)
> Use only when Kerberos canâ€™t be used.

ðŸ”’ **Putting it together**
- Kerberos by default for domainâ€‘joined clients and services
- NTLM only when required for compatibility

âœ… **Takeaway**
- Kerberos = secure, ticketâ€‘based SSO  
- NTLM = legacy; phase out where possible
