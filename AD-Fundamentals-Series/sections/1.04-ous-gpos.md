**‚ÄúOrganizational Units (OUs) and Group Policy‚Äù**

We now know how AD is structured at the domain, tree, and forest levels, and how it runs on Domain Controllers, Global Catalogs, and FSMO roles.  
The next step is understanding how objects are organized inside a domain and how rules are applied.  
That is where **Organizational Units (OUs)** and **Group Policy** come in.

## üóÇÔ∏è Organizational Units (OUs)
An **OU** is a container inside a domain. Think of it as a folder where you place objects such as users, groups, and computers.  

**Why OUs matter:**  
- Allow logical organization of objects (e.g., `OU=HR`, `OU=Finance`, `OU=IT`)  
- Enable **delegation of administration** (e.g., HR admins can control only the HR OU)  
- Are the **primary targets for Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**  

‚ö° **Key point:** OUs are not security boundaries. They are **administrative boundaries**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Group Policy
**Group Policy** is how administrators enforce settings across users and computers in the domain.  
Instead of configuring every machine one by one, rules are defined centrally and pushed out.

**What Group Policy can do:**  
- Control password policies  
- Map network drives and printers  
- Deploy software  
- Lock down desktops (disable Control Panel, restrict USB, etc.)  

**How it works:**  
1. A Group Policy Object (GPO) is created  
2. It is linked to a container (domain or OU)  
3. At logon/startup, GPO settings are applied  

‚ö° **Processing order (last wins):**  
1. Local policy  
2. Site policy  
3. Domain policy  
4. OU policy

## üîë Why OUs and GPOs matter
- **OUs** provide flexible organization and delegated control  
- **Group Policy** enforces consistent settings at scale  
- Together, they transform AD from just a directory into a **management system for the environment**

---

## ‚úÖ Takeaway
- **OUs** = logical grouping and delegated admin  
- **Group Policy** = enforced rules across users and devices  
- This combination makes AD a powerful identity and system management tool
