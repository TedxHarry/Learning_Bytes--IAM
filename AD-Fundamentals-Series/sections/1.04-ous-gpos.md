# 1.4 Organizational Units and Group Policy

We now know how AD is structured and powered. Next: how objects are organized **inside** a domain and how rules are applied — that’s **Organizational Units (OUs)** and **Group Policy**.

🗂️ **Organizational Units (OUs)**
- Containers inside a domain (e.g., `OU=HR`, `OU=Finance`, `OU=IT`)
- Enable **delegation** (give HR admins control over the HR OU only)
- Primary targets for **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
> Key point: OUs are **administrative boundaries**, not security boundaries.

🛠️ **Group Policy**
- Centralized way to enforce settings for users and computers
- Examples: password policies, map drives/printers, deploy software, lock down desktops
**How it applies**
1. Create a GPO  
2. Link it to a container (domain or OU)  
3. At logon/boot, settings apply
**Processing order (last wins):** Local → Site → Domain → OU

🔑 **Why it matters**
- OUs organize and delegate
- GPOs enforce consistent settings at scale

✅ **Takeaway**
- OUs = logical grouping and delegated admin  
- Group Policy = enforced rules across users/devices
