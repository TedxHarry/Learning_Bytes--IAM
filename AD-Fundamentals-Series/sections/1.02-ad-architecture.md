# 1.2 AD Architecture: Domains, Trees, Forests

Now that you know what a directory service is and why it exists, let’s step into the world of Active Directory’s architecture. Microsoft did not just build a flat database. They designed a hierarchy that can scale from a small office to a global enterprise. The three layers you need to master are **domains**, **trees**, and **forests**.

🌍 **Domains — the foundation**
- A domain is the core building block of Active Directory.
- It’s tied to a DNS name such as `corp.company.com`.
- Authentication is handled by the domain controllers for that domain.
- It’s a **security boundary**; trust outside isn’t automatic.

🌳 **Trees — when domains expand**
- A **tree** is a group of domains that share a contiguous namespace.
- Trust between parent and child domains is automatic.
- An account created in `sales.company.com` can be recognized across the `company.com` tree.

🌲 **Forests — the ultimate boundary**
- A **forest** holds one or more trees.
- All domains share the same **schema**, **configuration**, and **global catalog**.
- Trust is automatic between domains inside the forest.
- The **forest is the true security boundary** in AD.

🔑 **Why this matters**
- Small businesses may only need a single domain.
- Large enterprises may run multiple domains grouped into trees within a forest.
- Trust is clear: domains trust each other automatically in a forest; forests only trust each other if you configure it.

✅ **Takeaway**
- **Domain** = core security boundary  
- **Tree** = collection of related domains under one namespace  
- **Forest** = top-level boundary that contains one or more trees
