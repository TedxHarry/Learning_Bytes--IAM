# 1.15 Practical Pitfalls and Migration Considerations

Real migrations break on hidden assumptions. Avoid common traps with simple safeguards.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common pitfalls**
- UPN/sign‚Äëin mismatch and support tickets
- Bad matching ‚Üí duplicates/orphans
- Over‚Äësyncing privileged/service accounts
- Assuming every app accepts modern tokens
- No fallback for agent/network failures
- Skipping AD health checks (time/DNS/replication)

üõ° **Safeguards**
- Inventory apps + auth; pilot a small OU
- Exclude privileged/service accounts early
- Confirm UPN/mail/matching on samples
- Ensure agent HA; define fallback behavior
- Centralize logs; alert on sign‚Äëin/sync errors

üß≠ **Rollback & cutover checklist**
- Pre‚Äësync export for reconciliation
- Final attribute sanity check for pilot users
- Agent HA verified; fallback tested
- Monitoring/alerts active
- Rollback steps documented; owners assigned
- Support team briefed

‚úÖ **Takeaway**
Plan for small failures. Move in waves. Validate every app touching identity and keep rollback simple and ready.
