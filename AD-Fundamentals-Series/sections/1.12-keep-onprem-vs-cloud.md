# 🏆 `Section 1.12` | AD Fundamentals - **“When to Keep AD On-Prem, and When to Move Identity to Cloud Only”**

Most migrations are not all or nothing.  
The real question is which workloads need the **on-prem features AD provides**, and which can safely move to **cloud identity**.  
Make decisions per app, per device, and per business requirement — not by slogans.

---

## 🌐 When to Keep AD On-Prem
- You rely on **Group Policy** for device configuration and controls  
- Critical services use **Kerberos** or require **LDAP binds**  
- Legacy applications expect **Windows integrated authentication**  
- Regulatory or network constraints require **on-prem authentication**  
- Domain-joined machines and on-prem servers must keep their existing trust model  

---

## ☁️ When to Move Identity to Cloud-Only
- Your estate is **SaaS-first** and devices are managed by modern **MDM**  
- Applications accept **OAuth, SAML, or OpenID Connect tokens** natively  
- You can remove **LDAP and Kerberos** dependencies (or modernize apps first)  
- You want to reduce on-prem operations and accept the migration effort  
- Your security posture supports **password hash sync** or reliable federation  

---

## 🧭 Practical Decision Checklist
- Inventory every app and list its **auth method and dependencies**  
- Group devices by **management posture** (domain-joined vs MDM-managed)  
- Identify **service accounts** and test migration impact in a sandbox  
- Run a small **pilot** by OU or business unit and measure success criteria  
- Prepare **rollback steps** for each wave and validate backups and monitoring  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- Keep **AD** when you need device policy, Kerberos, or LDAP  
- Move to **cloud-only** when apps and device management no longer rely on on-prem features  
- Plan by **waves**, test hard cases first, and always have a rollback path
