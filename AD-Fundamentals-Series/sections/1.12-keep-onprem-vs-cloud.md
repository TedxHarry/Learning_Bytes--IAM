# 1.12 When to Keep AD On‑Prem vs Cloud‑Only

Migrations aren’t all‑or‑nothing. Decide **per app and device**.

🌐 **Keep AD on‑prem when**
- You rely on **Group Policy**
- Critical services use **Kerberos** or require **LDAP binds**
- Legacy apps need Windows integrated auth
- Regulatory/network constraints require on‑prem auth
- Domain‑joined machines/servers depend on the existing trust model

☁️ **Go cloud‑only when**
- Estate is **SaaS‑first** and devices are **MDM‑managed**
- Apps accept **OAuth/SAML/OIDC** natively
- You can remove Kerberos/LDAP dependencies
- You want to reduce on‑prem ops and accept migration work
- Security posture supports **PHS** or reliable federation

🧭 **Decision checklist**
- Inventory apps + auth methods
- Group devices by posture
- Identify service accounts and test in sandbox
- Pilot by OU/business unit; measure success
- Prepare rollback steps for each wave

✅ **Takeaway**
Keep AD when you need device policy, Kerberos, or LDAP. Move when apps and device management no longer require them — plan in waves with rollback.
