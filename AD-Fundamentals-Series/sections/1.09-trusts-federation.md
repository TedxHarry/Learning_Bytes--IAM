# 1.9 Trusts and Federation

Large environments need cross‑boundary access. That’s **trusts** and **federation**.

🔗 **Trusts**
Allow authentication to flow between domains/forests.
- Direction: one‑way or two‑way
- Scope: **transitive** or **non‑transitive**

🌍 **Types of Trusts**
- **Parent‑Child** (auto, transitive, two‑way)  
- **Tree‑Root** (auto, transitive, two‑way)  
- **External** (manual, non‑transitive)  
- **Forest** (between forests, transitive)  
- **Shortcut** (optimize auth within a forest)  
- **Realm** (AD ↔ non‑Windows Kerberos)

🌐 **Federation vs Trusts**
- Trusts connect AD domains/forests
- **Federation** connects AD to external identity systems (e.g., ADFS, SAML/OIDC for SaaS SSO)

🔒 **Security**
- A weak trusted domain can expose stronger ones; limit and monitor trusts

✅ **Takeaway**
- Trusts move auth across boundaries; federation extends AD to external systems
