# 1.14 Directory Sync Tools and Design Decisions

Sync agents are simple; **design** is the hard part. Treat sync as critical infrastructure.

ðŸ”§ **Core functions**
- Copy selected AD attributes to cloud
- Match identities via UPN/ImmutableID
- Optional writeback
- Lightweight agents that must be reachable and monitored

ðŸŽ¯ **Design principles**
- Start small; expand in waves
- Align UPN with signâ€‘in name
- Inventory attributes; mark required fields
- Decide matching rules early; test
- Least privilege for sync account; rotate creds
- Plan HA for agents; centralize logs and alert

âœ… **Compact checklist**
- UPN alignment confirmed
- Attribute inventory + mapping complete
- Matching rule tested on samples
- OU scope and wave plan set
- Password writeback decision recorded
- Agent HA + firewall rules validated
- Logging/alerts in place
- Smoke tests + rollback steps documented
- Time, DNS, replication health verified

âœ… **Takeaway**
The tool is simple. Good design is not. Test matching thoroughly, harden accounts, and monitor from day one.
