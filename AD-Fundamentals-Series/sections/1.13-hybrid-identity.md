# 1.13 Hybrid Identity Patterns

Hybrid identity is a toolbox. Choose based on control, resilience, and complexity.

🔐 **Password Hash Sync (PHS)**
- Hashes synced to cloud; cloud auth works even if on‑prem is offline
- Simple and resilient; align UPN/password policies

🔁 **Pass‑Through Authentication (PTA)**
- Cloud sign‑ins validated by on‑prem agent in real time
- No hashes stored in cloud; plan HA and monitor agents/network

🏛 **Federation (on‑prem IdP)**
- On‑prem IdP issues tokens (SAML/OIDC) for cloud apps
- Full control and custom flows; more infra to run and secure

☁️ **Cloud‑first provisioning**
- Identities created/provisioned in the cloud
- Best with MDM‑managed devices and token‑ready apps

✅ **Takeaway**
Test a small wave, watch sign‑in logs, and keep fallbacks for agent/network failures.
