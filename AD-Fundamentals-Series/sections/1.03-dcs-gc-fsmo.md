# 1.3 Domain Controllers, Global Catalog, FSMO Roles

We have talked about the structure — domains, trees, and forests. Now let’s look at the engines that make this structure actually work. The three key pieces are **Domain Controllers**, **Global Catalogs**, and **FSMO roles**.

🖥️ **Domain Controllers (DCs)**
A Domain Controller stores a writable copy of the AD database and handles identity operations.
- Authenticates users when they log in
- Enforces security policies
- Stores and replicates the AD database across other DCs
- Hosts the Kerberos KDC that issues tickets
> Every domain must have at least one DC. Most enterprises deploy multiple DCs for redundancy and load balancing.

🌐 **Global Catalog (GC)**
- Stores a **partial replica** of every object in the forest
- Holds only the most important attributes
- Enables fast forest‑wide searches and universal group lookups during logon
> Without a GC, logons can fail in multi‑domain forests because group memberships can’t be evaluated.

⚙️ **FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)**
AD is multi‑master, but some operations are single‑master:
- **Forest‑wide (1 per forest):** Schema Master, Domain Naming Master
- **Domain‑wide (1 per domain):** RID Master, PDC Emulator, Infrastructure Master
> Schema Master, Domain Naming Master, and PDC Emulator are mission‑critical.

✅ **Takeaway**
- **DCs** handle authentication, policy, and replication  
- **GC** enables forest‑wide search and universal group evaluation  
- **FSMO roles** prevent conflicts in schema, naming, and ID allocation
