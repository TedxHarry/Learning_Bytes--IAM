# 🏆 `Section 1.8` | AD Fundamentals - **“AD Schema and Attributes”**

Every directory has rules. In Active Directory, those rules live in the **schema**.  
The schema defines what kinds of objects you can create, and what information those objects can hold.

---

## 📖 What is the Schema?
Think of the schema as the **blueprint** of Active Directory.  

It defines:  
- **Object classes** → types of objects like users, groups, computers  
- **Attributes** → pieces of information each object can store  

**Examples:**  
- A user object must have `sAMAccountName` (logon name)  
- A user may also have optional attributes like `telephoneNumber` or `title`  
- A computer object has attributes like `operatingSystem` and `lastLogon`  

Without the schema, AD would have no rules about what an object looks like.

## 🧩 Attributes in Action
Attributes are what make objects useful.  

When you look at a user profile in AD, you are seeing attributes such as:  
- `cn` (Common Name)  
- `mail` (Email address)  
- `memberOf` (Groups the user belongs to)  
- `userPrincipalName` (UPN for logon)  

Applications that connect to AD rely heavily on attributes:  
- Exchange uses `mail`  
- HR apps may sync with `employeeID`

---

## ✏️ Extending the Schema
Sometimes organizations need more than the default attributes.  
For example, you may want to track an `officeLocationCode` for building access.  

In that case, the schema can be **extended** to add new attributes or even new object classes.  

⚠️ **Important:** Extending the schema is **forest-wide and permanent**.  
Once added, the change replicates to every Domain Controller in the forest.  
That is why schema changes are tightly controlled.

---

## 🔑 Why this matters
- The **schema** defines what AD can and cannot store  
- **Attributes** power almost every integration and search  
- **Extensions** let AD adapt to business needs but must be planned carefully  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- **Schema** = blueprint for objects  
- **Attributes** = actual data stored about each object  
- **Extensions** are possible but permanent → plan carefully
