# 🏆 `Section 1.2` | AD Fundamentals **“Architecture: Domains, Trees, Forests”**

Now that you know what a directory service is and why it exists, let’s step into the world of Active Directory’s architecture. Microsoft did not just build a flat database. They designed a hierarchy that can scale from a small office to a global enterprise. The three layers you need to master are **domains, trees, and forests**.

## 🌍 Domains: the foundation
A **domain** is the core building block of Active Directory.  
- It is a container where users, groups, computers, and policies live  
- It is tied to a DNS name such as `corp.company.com`  
- All authentication is handled by the domain controllers for that domain  
- Most importantly, it is a **security boundary** → rules apply inside the domain, and trust outside is not automatic  

💡 Think of a domain as the organization’s home ground, where everything is managed consistently.

## 🌳 Trees: when domains expand
Sometimes one domain is not enough. Maybe the company wants `sales.company.com` and `hr.company.com` to operate as separate domains but still remain connected.  

That is where **trees** come in:  
- A tree is a group of domains that share a contiguous namespace  
- Trust between parent and child domains is automatic  
- An account created in `sales.company.com` can be recognized across the entire `company.com` tree

## 🌲 Forests: the ultimate boundary
At the very top sits the **forest**. A forest is the umbrella that holds one or more trees.  

Inside a forest:  
- All domains share the same **schema** (the blueprint for objects and attributes)  
- All domains share the same **configuration** and **global catalog**  
- Trust is automatic between domains inside the forest  

🔑 The forest is the **true security boundary** in Active Directory.  
If you trust the forest, you trust everything inside it. If not, you must create a separate forest.

---

## 🔑 Why this matters
This layered design is what makes Active Directory powerful:  
- A small business may only need a single domain  
- A large enterprise may run multiple domains, grouped into trees, inside a forest  
- Trust is clear: domains trust each other automatically in a forest, but forests only trust each other if you configure it  

---

## ✅ Takeaway
- **Domain** → core security boundary  
- **Tree** → collection of related domains under one namespace  
- **Forest** → top-level boundary that contains one or more trees
